Hi ! Apart from getting the code up and running ,we also need to be PEP8 compliant.
let's talk about it briefly.
It has following standards:
1. 4spaces of identation-spaces preferred,not tabs
2. All lines limit to 79 characters
3. Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
4. Imports should usually be on separate lines

Thanks !
